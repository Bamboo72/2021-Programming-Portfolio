Inputs: ounces per day, life expectancy in years
Outputs: amount in 11,000 gallon tankers

Take an input from the user asking for their estimated amount of ounces of fluid intake per day
Take an input from the user asking for their estimated life expectancy in years
Life expectancy in days = life expectancy in years * 365.2425 (Due to leap years)
Amount of ounces in lifetime = ounces per day * life expectancy in days
Amount of gallons in lifetime = amount of ounces in lifetime / 128
Amount of 11,000 gallon tankers in lifetime = amount of gallons in lifetime / 11,000
Output to the user how many 11,000 gallon tankers they are expected to consume in their lifetime
