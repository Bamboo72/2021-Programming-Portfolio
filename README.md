# Spotlighted Projects created in the Programming 2 class 2020 - 2021:
 
## First Semester Birthday Countdown
  
### Completed September 2020
 
 
 This project displays the days left until my family member's birthday. This was one of our first assignments that utilized Swing to create graphics, but it also utilized a Day class to handle the time until each birthday.

## First Semester Maze Solving Robot
  
### Completed September 2020
 
 
 This was the first textbook project I completed in Programming 2, and was the inspiration for my Individual Project. This project is able to determine if a maze is solvable or not. It originally used a maze created manually in a 2D array, but I later changed it to use randomly generated mazes.

## First Semester Table Application?
 
### Completed
 
  This project was a simple but interesting project that allows the user to pass in strings to a table and then display them. The strings are entered in CSV (comma-separated values) format. Hypothetically, this code could be used to create large tables for real data. (Although, I think much more development would be needed to make it usable.)

## Second Semester Recursion Practice

### Completed

 This was our first introduction to recursion.

## Second Semester Guessing Game
 
### Completed February 2021
 
 This was a simple guessing game, similar to the one I made in year 1, but this time it can record the time users take to guess the number, and then record the user's name, time, and amount of guesses to a file.

## Second Semester Individual Project: Maze Game
 
### Completed March 2021
 
  This was an idea expounded from my first textbook project for this year. In this game you select the size of maze you want to complete and then use the mouse or arrow keys to navigate to the end. The graphics are displayed entirely using Swing. It's fairly simple, but gave me the practice I needed for the Year 2 Group Project. Fun fact, this project was initially meant to be incorporated into a dating sim game, but the project size was too ambitious for the time limit I had. I determined that the maze game alone would be a better individual project.

## Second Semester Group Project: The Isle of Laeso
 
### Completed May 2021
 
  This was the biggest project of Programming 2 class. I worked with three of my peers to create a Catan inspired board game called The Isle of Laeso. In this Viking themed game you customize your character, collect resources, build structures, and compete against the other players to win through three different methods: escape, kill, or ascend. I came up with the concept and thus was the project manager. I was also in charge of creating the game art and code for displaying the graphics, which turned out to be a bigger job than I originally anticipated. I made the graphics in Adobe Illustrator, and displayed the graphics using Swing.

  and note that I also made the [MousePressListener](https://github.com/Bamboo72/Programming2GroupProject1/blob/main/src/MousePressListener.java) and the [BuildMenuMousePressListener](https://github.com/Bamboo72/Programming2GroupProject1/blob/main/src/BuildMenuMousePressListener.java).
