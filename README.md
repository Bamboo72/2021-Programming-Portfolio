## Second Semester Number Guessing Game

### Completed March 2019

 Due to the limits C++ has with graphics, this is entirely text based. It's a simple but fun game where you try to guess a number in the least amount of guesses.

## Second Semester Recorded Questions
 
### Completed April 2019
 
 This was a simple app to help us learn how to work with files. All it really does is take the input from the user and record it for ten different questions.

## Second Semester Group Project: Bank System
 
### Completed May 2019
 
  This was a group project including all the students learning C++ in our Programming 1 class. Together we decided to create a banking system or automated teller. I was assigned the job of the bank system with deposits, withdrawls, recording the process, and keeping track of the balance of each user.
