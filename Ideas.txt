Ideas for projects to include in this portfolio:

- Mention Sterling Scholar in Computer Technology (Made it to the Semi-finals)

Semester 1:
- Choose Your Own Adventure Game? (Maybe not, since it wasn't for the class)
+ Birthday Countdown
- Maze Robot
- Table application?
- Check at home for any other projects in the files at home. 

Semester 2:
- Individual Project Maze Game
- Group Project The Isle of Laeso
- Recursion
+ Guessing game
- Something with inheritance like AbstractTutorial or Pet

- I think most of my projects are at home
