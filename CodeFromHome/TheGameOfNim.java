/* Instructions from the textbook:
 * The game of Nim. This is a well-known game with a number of variants. The
 * following variant has an interesting winning strategy. Two players
 * alternately take marbles from a pile. In each move, a player chooses how many
 * marbles to take. The player must take at least one but at most half of the
 * marbles. Then the other player takes a turn. The player who takes the last
 * marble loses.
 * 
 * Write a program in which the computer plays against a human opponent.
 * 
 * Generate a random integer between 10 and 100 to denote the initial size of
 * the pile. 
 * 
 * Generate a random integer between 0 and 1 to decide whether the
 * computer or the human takes the first turn. 
 * 
 * Generate a random integer between
 * 0 and 1 to decide whether the computer plays smart or stupid.
 * 
 *  In stupid mode
 * the computer simply takes a random legal value (between 1 and n/2) from the
 * pile whenever it has a turn. 
 * 
 *  In smart mode the computer takes off enough
 * marbles to make the size of the pile a power of two minus 1â€”that is, 3, 7,
 * 15, 31, or 63. That is always a legal move, except when the size of the pile
 * is currently one less than a power of two. In that case, the computer makes a
 * random legal move.
 * 
 * You will note that the computer cannot be beaten in smart mode when it has
 * the first move, unless the pile size happens to be 15, 31, or 63. Of course,
 * a human player who has the first turn and knows the winning strategy can win
 * against the computer.
